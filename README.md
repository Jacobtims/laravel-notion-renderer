## Generate HTML from Notion Page

This package converts all the blocks in a Notion page into HTML using Notion's API.
For more details on Notion API, please refer this page: https://developers.notion.com/

Currently, the Notion API returns the content in a form of JSON.
You can see example for JSON format here: https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer/y222f395f for this page: https://tested-wheel-e55.notion.site/Example-Page-6927be844d994e51bdda5f0c903f6788

Our renderer converts the JSON and converts it into HTML (converting to Markdown is work in progress), which you can use to render in your web application.

---
## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require rehankanak/laravel-notion-renderer 
```
---
## Usage

```php
$pageHTML = (new NotionRenderer('yourPageId'))->html();
```

That's it ðŸŽ‰

Your Notion Page is now converted to HTML and can use displayed in your web application.

Recommendation: We suggest to use https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin to style the HTML (or you may use your own CSS for the styling).

Note: The NotionRenderer class extensively uses Notion's Block API (https://developers.notion.com/reference/get-block-children) to get
the content of the Notion Page. Also, your API key must be present at `.env` file, check the `config` file of the package for more details.
